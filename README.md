All the files for the YouTube 3d Minecraft tutorial are located here!

NOTE! IF YOU WISH TO USE THIS PROGRAM FOR COMMERCIAL USE, YOU MUST ADVERTISE OR CREDIT ME! :)

Hey! You can download the latest code from the series from here. 
Download the whole repository as a zip or just as a folder. 
If you download it as a ZIP, you will need to extract it.
Then, just open the folder and click on the 3dminecraft.html to open the minecraft program.
Oh and make sure to open the minecraft.html file as a server!

If you have any questions, please ask either here or in youtube.

Find me in youtube at Hritik RC (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcGIeUrE5IpTHk9S2R_l0uQ?view_as=subscriber)
